1. What are while loops in Python?
> While loops let the computer execute a set of instructions while a condition is true.

2. Fill in the blanks to make the print_prime_factors function print all the prime factors of a number. A prime factor is a number that is prime and divides another without a remainder
>
def print_prime_factors(number):
  # Start with two, which is the first prime
  factor = 2
  # Keep going until the factor is larger than the number
  while factor <= number:
    # Check if factor is a divisor of number
    if number % factor == 0:
      # If it is, print it and divide the original number
      print(factor)
      number = number / factor
    else:
      # If it's not, increment the factor by one
      factor+=1
  return "Done"

print_prime_factors(100)
# Should print 2,2,5,5
# DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT

3. The following code can lead to an infinite loop. Fix the code so that it can finish successfully for all numbers.
Note: Try running your function with the number 0 as the input, and see what you get!

4.Fill in the empty function so that it returns the sum of all the divisors of a number, without including it. A divisor is a number that divides into another without a remainder.

5. The multiplication_table function prints the results of a number passed to it multiplied by 1 through 5. An additional requirement is that the result is not to exceed 25, which is done with the break statement. Fill in the blanks to complete the function to satisfy these conditions.
